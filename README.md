Student Grade Prediction Using Regression

Project Overview
- This project applies regression analysis to predict students' final grade(G3) based on two factors: Weekly Study Time (X1) using a 1-4 scale and Number of school absences (X2) from 0 - 93
- This project demonstrates how effort and engagement affect academic success by modeling the relationship between study habits, attendance, and performance.
- The dataset comes from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.

Variables
- Target(Y): G3 - Final grade(continuos variable)
- Predictor (X1, X2): 
  - studytime — Weekly study time (1–4, categorical)
  - absences — Number of school absences (continuous, 0–93)
